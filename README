Secure service for managing documents

This project implements a secure service for managing documents in a company
containing different departments. 
The system consists in a server, a certification authority and multiple clients
that can upload or download documents depending on their permissions on
different documents. 
All the connections are SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) using signed certificates
by my own implementation of certification authority.
All three programs can be run using the ant build file.
